WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net U_CPU_Core/U_DP/U_PC/q_reg[2]_7[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U_CPU_Core/U_DP/U_PC/IDR_reg[3]_i_1/O, cell U_CPU_Core/U_DP/U_PC/IDR_reg[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
