2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net U_CPU_Core/U_DP/U_PC/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U_CPU_Core/U_DP/U_PC/IDR_reg[3]_i_1/O, cell U_CPU_Core/U_DP/U_PC/IDR_reg[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#1 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port IOPortD[0] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#2 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port IOPortD[1] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#3 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port IOPortD[2] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>

RPBF-3#4 Warning
IO port buffering is incomplete  
Device port IOPortD[3] expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
Related violations: <none>
